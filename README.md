# Colmar Academy

The capstone project for *CodeCademy Ready*.

## Description
>You are tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school. You will help them by making informed design decisions about color and typography using the skills you learned last week. You will then implement your design[...] For this project you will implement the site specified by the wireframes and make all remaining design decisions to complete the site.

## Design notes

### Changes
- **Omitted 185px space in mobile layout.** I made a deliberate choice to exclude this page element because I felt it detracted from the flow of the site.
